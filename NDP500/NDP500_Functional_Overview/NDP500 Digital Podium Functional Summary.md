### **CBX Expansion Control**

- **Wireless Control via CBX**: The CBX expansion module connects wirelessly to the NDP500 via 2.4G Wi-Fi, enabling remote control of devices like air conditioning, lighting, and interactive flat panels. This module supports control through infrared, relay, and RS232 interfaces, offering flexible management without complex wiring.

### **Task Scheduling**

- **Task Scheduling Functionality**: The NDP500 features a robust **task scheduling capability**. Users can pre-set timed operations for devices through the Q-NEX platform or Web Console. Whether for device power management, specific content playback, or scheduled tasks, this function helps campus administrators and teachers streamline daily operations and improve efficiency. It’s particularly suited for long-term planning and automated management scenarios, such as centralized classroom device control, scheduled broadcast tasks, and remote device updates.

### **Device Control Methods**

The NDP500 provides multiple flexible and efficient control options to meet various usage needs:

**Touch Panel**: Supports local, single-device control, ideal for teachers or presenters to operate the NDP500 directly within the classroom.

**Web Console**: Supports cascading control of multiple devices, enabling cross-classroom, cross-device unified management and control, suitable for multi-classroom solutions.

**Web Dashboard**: Not only supports device management but also provides dynamic configuration options. Users can select control modes for different devices (e.g., controlling a PTZ camera or interactive flat panel via RS232 interface). The control layout and interaction options are tailored to the device type, enhancing management flexibility.

**Q-NEX APP**: Provides **anytime, anywhere device control**, allowing users to operate and manage the NDP500 and its connected devices remotely from mobile devices.
