###  2.1 **Device Control Methods**

The NDP500 provides multiple flexible and efficient control options to meet various usage needs:

**Touch Panel**: Supports local, single-device control, ideal for teachers or presenters to operate the NDP500 directly within the classroom.

**Web Console**: Supports cascading control of multiple devices, enabling cross-classroom, cross-device unified management and control, suitable for multi-classroom solutions.

**Web Dashboard**: Not only supports device management but also provides dynamic configuration options. Users can select control modes for different devices (e.g., controlling a PTZ camera or interactive flat panel via RS232 interface). The control layout and interaction options are tailored to the device type, enhancing management flexibility.

**Q-NEX APP**: Provides **anytime, anywhere device control**, allowing users to operate and manage the NDP500 and its connected devices remotely from mobile devices.
