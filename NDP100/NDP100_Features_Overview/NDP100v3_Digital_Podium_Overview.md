[toc]



## 1. **Overview**

- **NDP100**: The NDP100 is a fully-featured digital podium, integrating display, interactivity, audio, and device control to create an efficient solution for smart classrooms. Equipped with a **21.5-inch interactive display** supporting both finger touch and **active capacitive pen input**, it enhances teaching interaction. It includes an **OPS module** and comes standard with **two wireless microphones** and a **gooseneck microphone**, providing clear audio solutions for lectures and classroom instruction.
- **CBX Extension**: Through **CBX wireless communication control**, the NDP100 expands its functionality for remote-controlled environments such as auditoriums or large lecture halls. This extension eliminates complex wiring, simplifying and streamlining device management in large spaces.
- **Multi-Classroom Cascade**: The NDP100 supports **cascaded operation** with other devices, such as the NDP500 and NMP. Deploying these devices across classrooms enables smart management and control campus-wide, delivering a unified smart campus solution.

### 1.1 **Control Levels and Platform Overview**

The NDP100 provides flexible and efficient control methods to meet diverse usage needs:

- **Touch Panel**: Supports localized single-device control, suitable for instructors to directly manage the NDP100 within the classroom.
- **Web-Console**: Allows for cascading control of multiple devices, enabling users to manage and control classrooms and equipment across multiple locations, ideal for multi-classroom solutions.
- **Q-NEX APP**: Provides **remote device control anytime, anywhere**. Users can manage the NDP100 and connected devices via mobile devices, allowing for flexible remote operation.
- **Web-Dashboard**: Supports both device management and dynamic configuration. Users can select control modes based on device requirements (e.g., RS232 for controlling PTZ cameras or IFPs), with automatic display of control layouts tailored to device type, greatly enhancing management flexibility.



## 2. **AV Control**

- **Video Matrix Switching**: The NDP100 includes powerful video matrix switching capabilities, allowing easy management of multiple video inputs and synchronization across multiple displays, ideal for teaching and presentation scenarios.
- **Main Screen Synchronization**: The main screen synchronization feature ensures that the NDP100’s interactive display and the classroom’s larger display show identical content, so students can view presentations clearly from any corner of the room.
- **Touch-Following Technology**: This feature enables seamless touch operation across multiple input sources, allowing users to switch between devices without interrupting touch functionality and ensuring a smooth, uninterrupted experience.



## 3. **Audio Control**

- **Speaker Output**: The NDP100 routes audio signals from HDMI inputs, wireless, and wired microphones to the classroom’s speakers, ensuring sound clarity throughout the space, suitable for lectures, presentations, and large meetings.
- **Multi-Audio Input Management**: The device can handle multiple audio inputs simultaneously and switch flexibly to meet different audio requirements across varied scenarios.



## 4. **Device Control**

- **Power Management**: Users can precisely manage the power settings of connected devices, such as interactive displays, projectors, and electronic equipment (e.g., screens and curtains), ensuring efficient energy use and safe operation.
- **Infrared Control**: Equipped with IR functionality, the NDP100 allows remote control of devices like air conditioners and projectors through pre-set or learned IR codes, simplifying environmental control in classrooms or meeting rooms.
- **RS232 Control**: The device supports RS232 control for external devices such as projectors and IFPs, providing flexible control options for multimedia teaching and presentation environments.



## 5. **Broadcast and Live Streaming Features**

- **Streaming Broadcast**: With built-in streaming decoding, the NDP100 supports remote broadcast commands through the Q-NEX platform, enabling preloaded media to be streamed to classroom displays, suitable for classroom broadcasts, campus announcements, and more.
- **Live Streaming**: Through the Q-NEX APP and Web Console, the NDP100 allows live streaming within the campus network. Users can stream video content from mobile cameras, IP cameras, etc., to connected classroom displays, supporting remote teaching, online conferences, and event broadcasting.



## 6. **CBX Extension Control**

- **Wireless Control via CBX**: The CBX extension module wirelessly connects to the NDP100 via 2.4G Wi-Fi, enabling remote control of devices such as air conditioners, lighting, and interactive displays. This module supports control via IR, relay, and RS232, allowing flexible device management without complex wiring.



## 7. **Task Scheduling**

- **Scheduling Feature**: The NDP100 features a robust scheduling system that allows users to pre-set timed operations through the Q-NEX platform or Web Console. From powering devices on and off to managing power settings or playing specific content, the scheduling feature automates tasks based on pre-set times and sequences, helping campus administrators or instructors streamline daily operations and boost efficiency. This function is ideal for scenarios that require long-term planning and automated management, such as unified device power control, scheduled broadcasts, and remote device updates.
